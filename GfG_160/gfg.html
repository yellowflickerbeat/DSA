        <h3>1.Find Second Largest Number</h3>
        <p id="lesson">variable=float('-inf')</p>
        <p>Initializing largest=second_largest=float('-inf') made count of test cases passed from 2 to 1120!!<br>
        This makes sure that my code works even if the array elemets are large negative numbers.
        </p>
        <p>I also had been applying wrong logic initially.<br>
        I was trying to sort it and then removed duplictes both of which was not working.<br>
        Instead it is easier to assign values.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Move Zeroes to the end </h3>
            <p>I tried to move the zeroes to a separate array while preserving the order.
                But the fuck, code was not working w/o initializing count.
                So:
                <p id="lesson">if array[i] != 0:
                    arr[i], arr[count] = arr[count], arr[i]
                    count += 1
                </p>

                if the data element is not equal to zero then it is exchanged with intial count<br>
                lets say there is the third zero at i=2, nothing happens<br>
                but next non zero element is exchanged with last zero<br>
                as count is being incremented the order of zeroes are preserved<br>
            </p>

        <h3>3. Next Lexigraphical Permutation</h3>
        <p id="lesson">Lexigraphical order:<br>
        First compare array elements from behind. If arr[i]< arr[i-1]<br>
        swap arr[i] with numerically smallest number in arr[i]'s right<br>
        Now reverse right of arr[i]</p>

        <p>First thought of swapping and using only i, then chatgpt happened</p>
