        <h3>1.Find Second Largest Number</h3>
        <p id="lesson">variable=float('-inf')</p>
        <p>Initializing largest=second_largest=float('-inf') made count of test cases passed from 2 to 1120!!<br>
        This makes sure that my code works even if the array elemets are large negative numbers.
        </p>
        <p>I also had been applying wrong logic initially.<br>
        I was trying to sort it and then removed duplictes both of which was not working.<br>
        Instead it is easier to assign values.
